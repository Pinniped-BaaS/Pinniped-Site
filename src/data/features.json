    "description": "Extensibility, in Pinniped’s terms, is how much backend functionality can be built before resorting to a backend that better suits the user’s requirements. Pinniped's functionality is extendable within the backend's source code with JavaScript. As a result, Pinniped supports up-to-date JavaScript ES6 features and Node APIs. Although serverless functions are the industry standard, serverless functions have innate issues of increased network latency and configuration complexities. These issues undermine Pinniped’s goals, which influenced Pinniped to focus on supporting JavaScript natively."
